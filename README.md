# Go Language Learnings

- GO is an open-source programming langague supported by Google.
- GO lang has a single distribution/ installable that helps write, build and run Go programs.
- Unlike Java, Go directly compiles into machine level code. Hence compiled code is not "run everywhere" code.
- To support multi platform compatibility, Go provides cross-compilation feature. This means you can build into Linux compatible binary on Windows platform and vice versa.
- Go programs are saved with .go extension
- How to build/ compile Go program
    - `go build -o <<Executable-name>> <<program-name.go>>`
    - `go install <<program-name.go>>`
        - This command builds and installs executable in `user/go/bin` folder for Windows
        - If the above dir is in the Env path variable, executable can be run from anywhere
- How to test Go program
    - Create _test.go that contains functions names TestXXX with signature func (t *Testing.T)
    - `go test`
- How to run Go program
    - `<<Go-executable-name>>`
    - Or `go run <<program-name.go>>`
- Go project structure
    - Go programs are bundled into packages
    - Go packages are bunded into module
    - Go project may have one or more modules
- How to create a module
    - Run `go mod init <<module-name>>` from root folder 
    - This creates a go.mod file in root folder
    - External dependenices are included in go.mod file. Its kind of a build file
    - Local dependencies are included by performaing local module replacements
- Go workspaces
    - Defines a workspace
    - useful in scenarios where you're developing and testing changes across several modules simultaneously, without needing to push those changes to a remote repository or perform local module replacements in go.mod files.
    - Create a go.work file at root location of the project
    - Import modules in go.work using `use` keyword.
    - Simplifies dependency management , enhances local development and flexibility
- Cross-platform compilation
    - set GOOS and GOARCH environment variable and then run go build command
    - e.g  Build Linux compatiblle Go executable on Windows platform using following command
        - `GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build <<executable-name>> <<program-name.go>>`

- Data Structures
    - Arrays (Static)
    - Slices (Dynamaic Array)
    - Maps (Key-value)
    - Struct (User defined objects)
    - Interfaces (OO)
    - Channels (Go routines for Concurrancy)

- Helpful commands
    - go version
    - go tool dist list
    - go mod tidy
    - go build
    - go run
    - go install
